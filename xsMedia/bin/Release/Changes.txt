*** Version 2.1.9 - , 2025 ***
- Updated VLC libraries to version 3.0.21
- Implemented an audio mute function
- Replaced all icons (except main application icon) with better looking ones, and ones that made more sense to the function they were representing
- Added hotkey support for skip forward/backward (right arrow/left arrow) of media, volume up/down (+/-), mute (m), pause/resume (space or k) and fullscreen (f (esc also exits fullscreen))
- Minor internal code refactoring
- Minor dialog cosmetic changes
- Fixed issue with open network and effects dialogs not initially centering to the main player window
- Most dialogs now remember the position they were last moved to
- Fixed issue with main menu bar not being visible during full-screen mode
- Fixed issue with multiple players being opened if multiple files were selected in Windows explorer
- Added support for m4v and m4a files
- Added a right-click context menu for the video window, which is useful for when playing in full-screen mode
- Added a playback menu to main menu bar
- Added playback speed adjustment via new right-click context menu, or the "Playback" menu
- Added a jump to specific time dialog
- Added the option to either resize the player window to video size, or resize the video to the current window size (default is resize video to window size)
- Added option to display video title on playback screen for the time determined by "time out" seconds (5 - 30 seconds)
- Added recent file caching for single files opened by the player (25 max at the moment)
- Added a favorites dialog to store favorite files (currently only works with local hard drive files, not discs; why would it?)
- xsTrackBar.dll removed and moved code to xsCore.dll
- xsPlaylist.dll removed and code moved to xsCore.dll
- xsSettings.dll removed and code moved to xsCore.dll
- Added ability to change or remove MIDI soundfont support file (SF2)
- Fixed an issue with some settings not being saved to xsMedia.xml after the settings dialog OK button was clicked
- Fixed an update issue on the playlist window when skin was changed, text colors were not changing
- Fixed issue with drag and drop files from explorer not playing from the first added file (would play the same currently playing file (if playing))
- Implemented looping playback function; it can now loop one track over and over, loop all tracks (after playlist end is reached, restart from beginning) and random track play
- Changed it so when playlist window is showing, like most media players, we still have a media preview of playing file visible on the left
- Fixed an issue with the main window still displaying cover art from a previous audio file (and current playing one has no cover art)
- Managed to fix changing of album art of an MP3 file to update the cached information and show the change on the video window (it's probably not a good idea to change the album art while the file is playing)
- Fixed a focus issue to the video window after the playlist was hidden (caused every key press to make a Windows' ding sound)
- Fixed issue with remove duplicates replaying the playlist from the start (0) if there was already media playing (not sure why I did that that way)
- Added an "always on top" function, for people who want the player window to on top of all other windows

*** Version 2.1.8 - 22 September , 2020 ***
- Updated libVLC plugins to version 3.0.10
- Internal code libraries and main exe code clean up
- Made sure both mouse and keyboard hooks were removed on exit of program
- Update XML serializer code to handle unicode characters in files (not that this should be an issue - but was updated in another application, so just following through)
- Updated network presets as original ones no longer worked
- Settings dialog now remembers what "tab" is selected (also cleaned up internal code)
- Added support for playing MIDI files
- Hopefully fixed an exit crash bug by checking if media is actually playing/paused before calling stop
- Removed YouTube playback support as it no longer works (YT keep changing it and I can't be bothered constantly chasing it)
- Unfortunately, as of March 31 2020, freedb (which is used for getting CDDB information on CD tracks) has been shutdown. I managed to find a working alternative "http://gnudb.gnudb.org/~cddb/cddb.cgi"
